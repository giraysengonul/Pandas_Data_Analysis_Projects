# 🚕 Uber Ride Data Analysis – NYC

This project analyzes Uber pickup data in **New York City** using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Folium**.  
We explore temporal and spatial patterns in ride demand and visualize them with heatmaps and interactive charts.

## 📁 Dataset

- Raw Uber pickup data from NYC  
- Includes timestamps and GPS coordinates  
- Cleaned and transformed for time-series and spatial analysis

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

- Data type conversion and timestamp parsing  
- Null & duplicate removal  
- New columns: Hour, Weekday, Month  
- Latitude & Longitude parsing for mapping

---

## 🧠 What Did We Discover?

- **Friday & Saturday nights** show the highest demand  
- **Sunday evenings** drop sharply in comparison  
- **Thursday nights** have almost Friday-like activity – NYC starts the weekend early  
- **Folium HeatMap** shows pickup hotspots across the city at different hours

---

## 🗺️ Mapping with Folium

We used **Folium** and **HeatMap** plugin to:

- Create interactive NYC pickup maps  
- Analyze temporal density  
- Identify rush hours & urban mobility zones

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Folium  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 📄 Conclusion

This project shows how simple tools like **Pandas** and **Folium** can reveal deep insights into urban movement using real data. Great practice for data cleaning, feature extraction, time-series exploration, and spatial visualization.
